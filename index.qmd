## Introduce Yourself In Chat

-   Your Name/Group/Pronouns
-   What you hope to learn today

## Who is this workshop for?

-   Those who want a basic understanding of the version control process
-   Those who want to understand how open source collaboration works
-   Those who need to build a mental model of Git

. . .

Not for:

-   People who already use Git on the command line (you already have the mental model)
-   Impatient people

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

-   **Explain** the reasons we use repositories
-   **Explain** how version control tracks changes in your work
-   **Make** a branch in a repository
-   **Make** contributions to a repository using pull requests
-   (If time) **Make** a fork of a repository that you don't own

## Reminder: Be gentle with yourself and others

-   [Participation Guidelines](https://hutchdatascience.org/communitystudios/guidelines/)
-   We are all learning together
-   We all learn at different paces
-   Asking questions is a way of taking care of others

## Our focus today is on concepts

-   Intermediate Git is much more about how you do it

## Reproducibility and the Research Lifecycle

## Benefits of Storing your code in a Repo

-   Centralized code
-   Other people outside your lab can use it
-   The ability to roll back changes that broke your code
-   Recognition for your work
-   Supportive community that can help you learn and improve it

## It's Tough being Open

## Version Control

> Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a file, or set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later when needed.

:::

## Ways we work with version control

-   **By ourselves (sole developer)**
-   As a member of a GitHub repository
-   As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository

## Version Control Workflow (by ourselves)

1.  Create files - these may contain text, code or both.
2.  Work on these files, by changing, deleting or adding new content.
3.  Create a snapshot of the file status (also known as version) at this time.
4.  Document what was changed in the version history of that file.

## You probably already do a version of this:

## Git is a formal way of tracking changes

-   Each "save" is called a **commit**
-   Basically a snapshot of the file at that moment in time
-   We have one file, but many versions of that file
-   We only track changes in the file, not save the entire file
-   We can **revert** changes associated with a commit

![](main-branch-bf6b49a2efd6b2dc9e311e7a666e2b52.png)

## What's the diff-erence?

Git only tracks what's changed between commits (called a **diff**):

-   Lines of code we add (+)
-   Lines of code we delete (-)

## Diff Example

## Exercise: Create a repository and make a commit

<https://github.com/new>

## Exercise: Look at a complex commit history

-   [Exploring Github Exercise](exploring.html)

## Ways we work in a repository

-   By ourselves (sole developer)
-   **As a member of a GitHub repository**
-   As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository

## Git / GitHub is a way for multiple developers to work together

-   Everything we've done so far we've done by ourselves
-   The key with Git/GitHub is that multiple people can work on a repository at once

## How do we do this?

-   Multiple people can work on their own versions of the code called **branches**
-   Developers can work on different features on the same code
-   Needs a reconciliation process (pull requests/merging)

## Branches are isolated versions of the original repository

![](one-branch.png)

## Many People Can Work on the Same Code

-   Working on different branches

![](sub-branch-591cc047cf4f699fc4652eae25e2745d.png)

## When in doubt, branch

-   Before you make big changes, make a branch

## Exercise: Add a Recipe to our Cookbook Repository!

[Repository Member List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CeSnF2_6YMJgcZvYDCgYZqk-YINx1cSKkSkBgVSvkwI/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Everyone is a member of this repository:

-   [cookbook_winter_2026](https://github.com/fhdsl/cookbook_winter_2026)

[Exercise: Add a Recipe](branching.html)

## Make a Pull Request

-   A **pull request** is a formal request to merge your code changes into the history
-   Someone (the owner) needs to merge your changes after a request

## Exercise: Make a Pull Request

[Exercise: Make a Pull Request](pr.html)

## Reconciliation of Branches (merging)

![](one-branch-9bf2286640c44169cd8255c9d4264780.png)

-   Need to integrate changes in branches together
-   This is called a **merge**

## Who's responsible for merging?

-   Repository Owner
    -   Could be *program manager* of a group
    -   Could be a *software engineer*
-   It is a big responsibility
    -   Need to ensure that merge doesn't break things
        -   Use automated testing to ensure changes don't break code
    -   Need to make sure that merges don't conflict
        -   Reconciling changes so that they work together

## Branching/Merging works because of communication

-   You need to communicate with other developers which part of the code you're working on
-   Partition out the tasks
-   Multiple developers working on the same part of the code can be difficult

## Merging process

May involve...

-   Converse about the Pull Request

-   Participate in Code Reviews

-   Approve or Deny the Pull Request

# Merging Demo

## Ways we work in a repository

-   By ourselves (sole developer)
-   As a member of a GitHub repository
-   **As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository**

## GitHub lets you contribute to code, even if you aren't a member

-   You can still contribute to code you don't own
    -   Open source is built on collaborations
-   You can do this by making a *fork* of the code

## Forks

-   Your version of the code is called a *fork* - it belongs to you
    -   Like an external *branch*
    -   The fork belongs to you
-   Can submit your changes to the code through a *pull request* to the original repository:

-   **Explain** how version control tracks changes in your work
-   **Make** a branch in a repository
-   **Make** contributions to a repository using pull requests
