## Welcome!

-   GitHub: [sign up for an account ](https://github.com/signup "https://github.com/signup")if you don't have one yet,

-   Then [enter your GitHub username here in the spreadsheet](#0 "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vqrPd-0sga4STNJb2dW7ylnv_8aSQrsKEHpBtysDSzY/edit?gid=0#gid=0")

-   If you are all set, find a recipe that you can cut and paste as text (yes, for food or drinks) to share -- doesn't have to be yours! It's for a fun little exercise today.

## Introduce Yourself In Chat

-   Your Name/Group/Pronouns
-   What you hope to learn today
-   What's something delicious you have cooked or eaten lately?

## Who is this workshop for?

-   Those who want a basic understanding of the version control process
-   Those who want to understand how open source collaboration works
-   Those who need to build a mental model of Git

## Our focus today is on concepts

-   Intermediate Git is much more about how you do it with the Command Line

## Reproducibility and the Research Lifecycle

## What is a Repository?

-   Centralized files in a folder
-   The ability to look back in time (version control)
-   Other people can use it
-   Recognition for your work

## What is Version Control?

> Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a file, or set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later when needed.

:::

## Ways we work with version control

-   **By ourselves (sole developer)**
-   As a member of a GitHub repository
-   As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository

## Version Control Workflow (by ourselves)

1.  Create files in a repository.
2.  Work on these files, by changing, deleting or adding new content.
3.  Create a snapshot, aka **commit**, of the repository at this time.
    -   User, time, difference compared to last commit, documentation

## You probably already do a version of this:

## Git is a formal way of tracking changes

-   Each version is called a **commit**
-   We only track changes in the file, not save the entire file
-   We can **revert** changes associated with a commit

![](main-branch-bf6b49a2efd6b2dc9e311e7a666e2b52.png)

## What's the diff-erence?

Git only tracks what's changed between commits (called a **diff**):

-   Lines of code we add (+)
-   Lines of code we delete (-)

## Diff Example

## Exercise: Create a repository and make a commit

<https://github.com/new>

-   Create README.md

## Exercise: Look at a complex commit history

## Ways we work in a repository

-   By ourselves (sole developer)
-   **As a member of a GitHub repository**
-   As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository

## Git / GitHub is a way for multiple developers to work together

-   Everything we've done so far we've done by ourselves
-   The key with Git/GitHub is that multiple people can work on a repository at once

## How do we do this?

-   Multiple people can work on their own versions of the code called **branches**
-   Developers can work on different features on the same code
-   Needs a reconciliation process (**merging** via Pull Requests)

## Branches are isolated versions of the original repository

## Many People Can Work on the Same Code

## Exercise: Add a Recipe to our Cookbook Repository!

[Repository Member List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vqrPd-0sga4STNJb2dW7ylnv_8aSQrsKEHpBtysDSzY/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

Everyone is a member of this repository:

-   [cookbook_winter_2026](https://github.com/fhdsl/cookbook_winter_2026)

[Exercise: Add a Recipe](branching.html)

## Make a Pull Request

-   We are going to **merge** your code changes into the parent branch.
    -   Usually the **main branch**.
-   This requires careful communication. A **pull request** is the communication channel.
-   After a **pull request** is made, someone looks over and decides whether to **merge.**

## Exercise: Make a Pull Request

[Exercise: Make a Pull Request](pr.html)

## Merging...

![](one-branch-9bf2286640c44169cd8255c9d4264780.png)

-   Need to integrate changes in branches together
-   This is called a **merge**

## Who's responsible for merging?

-   Repository Owner
    -   Could be project manager of a group...
    -   Could be a software engineer...
    -   Could be a collaborator...
    -   Depends on a lot of context!

## Who's responsible for merging?

-   It is an important responsibility

    -   Check for any possible **conflicts** that may arise and address them

    <!-- -->

    -   Need to ensure that merge doesn't break things
        -   Use automated testing to ensure changes don't break code

## This is all dependent on communication

-   You need to communicate with other developers which part of the code you're working on
-   Partition out the tasks
-   Multiple developers working on the same part of the code can be difficult

# Merging Demo

## Ways we work in a repository

-   By ourselves (sole developer)
-   As a member of a GitHub repository
-   **As an external collaborator of a GitHub repository**

## GitHub lets you contribute to code, even if you aren't a member

-   You can still contribute to code you don't own
    -   Open source is built on collaborations
-   You can do this by making a *fork* of the code

## Forks

-   Your version of the code is called a *fork* - it belongs to you
    -   Like an external *branch*
    -   The fork belongs to you
-   Can submit your changes to the code through a *pull request* to the original repository:

## Recap of What we did

Hopefully you will now be able to

-   **Explain** the reasons we use repositories
-   **Explain** how version control tracks changes in your work
-   **Make** a branch in a repository
-   **Make** contributions to a repository using pull requests
-   **Make** a fork of a repository that you don't own
